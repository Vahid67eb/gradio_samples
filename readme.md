### <span style="color:yellow;">"</span> Gradio is an open-source Python library that is used to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications. <span style="color:yellow;">"</span>

# What is the use of <span style="color:yellow;">Gradio</span>?
### <span style="color:yellow;">"</span> With Gradio, you can quickly create a beautiful user interface around your machine learning models or data science workflow and let people "try it out" by dragging-and-dropping in their own images, pasting text, recording their own voice, and interacting with your demo, all through the browser. <span style="color:yellow;">"</span>

# What is our <span style="color:yellow;">Goal</span> in this repository?
### <span style="color:yellow;">"</span> The primary objective of this project is to provide a structured and step-by-step guide to understanding and using Gradio from the basics to advanced techniques. Whether you're new to Gradio or looking to extend your knowledge, this repository has something for everyone. <span style="color:yellow;">"</span>
